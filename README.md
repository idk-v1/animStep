Finds the first time a pixel is used in a set of animation frames and outputs a not for humans .png<br>
IMPORTANT: make sure all images are same size and consistantly named.<br>
I had a problem of out of order frames that didn't match windows file explorer sort.<br>
Example:<br>
1.png, 10.png, 100.png, 101.png, 102.png, ...<br>
2.png, 20.png, 21.png, 22.png, 23.png<br>
<br>
Fix:<br>
001.png, 002.png, ...<br>
099.png, 100.png, 101.png<br>
<br>

I used this to speed up making a cursive drawing animation for the arcade game Defender
